# GroceryTracking — Working Spec

_Status: gathering requirements. No code until the plan is approved._

## What the user has described

- Groceries come from **Walmart, Costco, Safeway, or local grocery stores**.
- Common thread: **every food item has a barcode**. Costco receipts also carry a barcode.
- **Task 1:** identify products from barcodes.
  - Preferred: scan the **receipt's barcode** to get all items at once.
  - Fallback: scan **individual products** one by one and identify each.

## Feasibility notes (agreed facts)

- Product barcodes (UPC/EAN) can be scanned with a phone camera and looked up in product databases, such as Open Food Facts (free).
- Store brands are only partly covered. Produce and deli items often have no standard barcode.
- A receipt barcode only holds a transaction ID, so it can't list the items.
- Alternative for receipts: **photo of the receipt → read the text (OCR/AI)**, or use the store's digital receipts.
